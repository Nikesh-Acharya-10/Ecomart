            <span class="more-text" style="display: none;"><!-- this is the more text that is hidden initially -->
                However,
                the technological advancements have made communication instant and more efficient.
                it is now possible to have video calls with people across the globe in real time.
                At 21st century, the internet is a major source of information and communication.
                Nowadays, one can share information in few seconds. Entertainment has also become simpler with the aid
                of
                technology where online videos, music applications, and online games are available.
                Technology has contributed a lot in education.
                The students are able to have web based classes, they can
                watch instructional videos and browse study materials online.
                Online libraries and resources enable the student to acquire additional knowledge other than the text
                books.
                Technology enables the learners to study at their speed and also enhances their comprehension of some
                awkward subjects.
                Making learning easier and availing it whenever there is an emergency, online education has become
                extremely
                convenient.
                Healthcare services have been enhanced through technology. The hospitals are equipped with contemporary
                machines and digital systems in diagnosing and treatment.
                Such online medical consultation and health apps allow individuals to obtain medical help without going

                    alt="Technology in daily life"><!-- As the image is show for the given topic -->
                Online banking and the use of mobile wallets as digital payment systems have seen financial transactions
                being quickly and safely carried out.
                The life has been organized and efficient with the help of technology. Technology has caused significant
                changes in the aspect of business.
                Computers, software, and digital tools are used by businesses to handle information such as data,
                accounts
                and customer information.
                Technology is used to ease paper work, conserve time and productivity. The business communication has
                also
                been enhanced with the help of emails, messaging applications, and video conferencing.
                Technology has resulted into many businesses being conducted across the globe. Technologies of web
                development like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also significant in the contemporary business.
                The basic structure of the websites i.e. headings, pictures, and links is created by the usage of HTML
                (HyperText Markup Language).
                The websites are designed and styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which makes the websites
                appealing
                and simple to use.
                JavaScript enhances the interaction of the websites making it possible to have such features as buttons,
                forms, pop-up messages, and dynamic content.
                the technologies assist businesses in designing professional websites that will be able to market their
                products and services.
                Businesses have the capability to communicate through websites and share products and information as
                well as
                carry out communication with customers.
                And, as an example, online stores can process product details with HTML, product cards with CSS, and
                additional functionality, such as an Add to Cart button, with JavaScript.
                The filter system is another key feature that the use of JavaScript makes possible.

                Filters give the opportunity to search and classify products in terms of categories, cost, or any other
                factors.
                Just as an example, customers will be able to filter the products according to the price (low-high),
                category, or type.
                This enhances customer experience and facilitates the search of products among the customers. The use of
                filters saves time and makes web sites efficient and this is very serious in the case of online
                business.
                One of the largest influences of technology on the business is E-commerce. Through online stores,
                business
                can be used to sell products to the global market without necessarily having to have physical stores.
                Customers have the ability to make comparisons, reviews and make orders at ease. The technology has also
                enabled the small businesses and startups to expand as access to online platforms can be accessed
                cheaply.
                Technology has transformed people mode of work. There are numerous businesses that give employees an
                opportunity to work at home using internet and computers.
                Collaboration tools, online meetings, and storage using clouds enable employees to promote effective
                collaboration. This is flexible, which enhances the work-life balance and saves travel costs.
                There are however some disadvantages to technology as well. Overindulgence in technology may lead to
                medical
                conditions such as straining of the eyes and physical inactivity.
                Automation can also eliminate some employment opportunities among the business individuals. The risk of
                cybersecurity and threats to data privacy are also on the rise.
                As such, the application of technology must be in a prudent manner. To sum up, technology has made
                significant positive impacts on the lives of people and business.
                It has enhanced business, communication, learning, and medical services. The use of technologies such as
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScripts have enabled the businesses to expand using websites and online platform.
                Such elements as filters have become quicker and more convenient. Even though technology has had some
                adverse impact, the positive aspects are much more.
                Technology will evolve the human life and the development of business in future when employed in a sound
                way.

        <h2>Impact of Microplastics on Marine Ecosystems</h2>
        <p>
            The most common type of plastic that is invisible everywhere in the sea is microplastics, the tiny plastic
            particles less than 5 mm in length known as microplastics have become widespread pollutants in the universe
            oceans,
            and their concentration is growing at an alarming rate and is likely to continue growing exponentially
            unless corresponding action is taken.
            Recent studies indicate that marine animals of different trophic levels, such as planktons, fish, and marine
            mammals, ingest microplastics.

                The ingestion of microplastics may lead to physical harm, chemical toxicity, and biological effects on
                the
                marine organisms.
                As an illustration, polluted planktons may not be as efficient in photosynthesis and carbon cycling
                undermining the ocean capacity to capture carbon and regulate climate.

                These are the particles that are formed of the destruction of greater plastic waste, synthetic fibers of
                the
                textile, and microbeads of consumer goods, introduced into the marine environment through rivers,
                runoff,
                and coastal trash.
                After ingestion, microplastics may result into physical, chemical toxicity (e.g., decreased feeding,
                growth
                stunted) and chemical toxicity related to pollutant (e.g., heavy metals, persistent organic compounds)
                engulfed by the plastics.<img src="Images/micro.png" class="imagess" alt="Microplastics in ocean">
                The marocopic effects of microplastics on marine organisms include obstruction of the digestive tract,
                reduced
                feeding stimulus, and energy depletion. microplastics may also act as vectors for the transfer of
                harmful chemicals and pathogens
                into the marine organisms. organisms that ingest microplastics may be exposed to toxic chemicals that
                are adsorbed onto the plastic
                surface, leading to bioaccumulation and biomagnification of these pollutants in the food web.
                in addition, microplastics may also serve as a substrate for the growth of harmful microorganisms, which
                may
                cause diseases in marine organisms.
                Results of these effects may include oxidative stress, behavioral alteration, reproductive problems and
                loss
                of life, thus disabling food webs and biodiversity.
                in conclusion, microplastics pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems and the organisms that
                inhabit them.
                As an illustration, their presence may disrupt the carbon cycling process through their interference of
                the
                phytoplankton, zooplankton, undermining the ability of the ocean to absorb the carbon, which may amplify
                the
                impacts of climate change.
